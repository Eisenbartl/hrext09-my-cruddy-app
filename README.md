Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

Overview: This mobile app 'Schnapsidy' pronounced schnaps-e-dee, which translates from German as 'liqour idea', prevents you from drunk texing/calling people.

note: the html files are meant to be viewed using the dev tools device toolbar.

 ## Tasks

 ### Basic Reqs
- [ ] Where to store data? (localstorage)
- [ ] How to caputure data? (web form)
- [ ] How to modify data? (update action, delete action)
- [ ] How to view data? (style?)
- [ ] UI/UX considerations (how are we going to use this)

The MVP for this project is to:
  1: Block yourself from texting or calling preselected contacts for a period of time.
  2: Be unable to block emergency numbers, i.e.: 911, poison control, etc.

 ### Advanced Reqs
Advanced goals:
  1: Buddy mode that alerts a friend who has been given temporary authority to deny or approve any calls or texts you are trying to make.
  2: Pre-record messages from sober you that pop up to dissuade intoxicated you from texting or calling.
  3: Block texts from sending that meet certain criteria like too many mispelled words, texts messages that are too long, or use key words that only a drunk person would think is appropriate to send someone.
  4: Timed logic puzzels that must be solved before any call or text is made.
  5: Keeps a record of all blocked texts you tried to make so you can look at them and see the good that this app is doing and makes you wonder how you ever lived without it.
