Create Read Update and Delete framework using JS

This mobile app 'Schnapsidy' pronounced schnaps-e-dee, which translates from German as 'liqour idea', prevents you from drunk texing/calling people.
The MVP for this project is to:
  1: Block yourself from texting or calling preselected contacts for a period of time.
  2: Be unable to block emergency numbers, i.e. 911, poison control, etc.
